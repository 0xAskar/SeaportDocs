# Definitions


### <u>Offer</u>: 
#### The offer is the token that you are trying to *purchase*. It is **not** what you are offering to buy the item with. It is the offer from the perspective of the seller.

###  <u>Considerations</u>: 
#### These are the items to exchange for the seller's item. Basically, it is what the buyer is going to give up.
###  <u>Start time</u>: 
#### Just the start time of the listing. It has to be at least 15 minutes ahead of when you're trying to invoke the function, so I usually try to do at least 20 minutes.
### <u>End time</u>: 
#### Time at which listing will end.
### <u>Salt</u>: 
#### it is a random number generated for entropy. Basically, adds another level of uniqueness to your transaction.
### <u>ConduitKey</u>: 
#### This is the specific permissions you're allowing your site or whatever this is being used on to transfer the tokens from that wallet. This is what you see when you first list or sell an item on Openseas. **NOTE:** You should not use the conduitKey I have below. The one I have below is for giving permissions for ANY token, which your users will not like nor should you have in case of exploit.
### <u>Zone & Zonehash</u>: 
#### These confuse me too; I will update this when I understand them better.
