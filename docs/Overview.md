# Overview

## What is this documentation?
This is documentation made by the community, for you and by you! Askar started this because the Seaport documentation provided by Opensea was a bit confusing for certain actions to be done. So, now this is the community edition. If you ever want to add or make edits, go to this [github](https://github.com/0xAskar/SeaportDocs) and make a pull request.

## What is Seaport?

Seaport is a new web3 protocol that enables the ability for any type of 
buying and selling of NFTs and Crypto. Here are its unique qualities:

- Open-sourced
- Decentralized
- Ability to create any type of order with any number of items on both sides of the transactions
- No need to use Opensea API keys (hence decentralized and open-sourced)
- Able to create your own marketplace with Seaport
- Easy to use *if you read good documentation ;)*
- Compatible with most languages
